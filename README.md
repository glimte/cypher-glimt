# Cypher-Glimt

Is a thin wrapper for Neo4j Cypher-Shell.    
It introduces the possibilities to use named profiles while working on multiple environments   
   
Future releases are planned to include password encryption and parsing of multiple files as input,   
for example by passing an entire folder using wildcards with the --file flag.
